## Exercises (required)


### The story {-}

Though far from a perfect assessment of academic preparedness, SAT scores have historically been used as one measurement of a state's education system. The `education` dataset contains various education variables for each state:

```{r}
# Import and check out data
education <- read.csv("https://mac-stat.github.io/data/sat.csv")
head(education)
```

A codebook is provided by Danny Kaplan who also made these data accessible:

### Exercise 1: SAT scores {-}

#### Part a {-}

Construct a plot of how the average `sat` scores vary from state to state. (Just use 1 variable -- `sat` not `State`!)

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
ggplot(education, aes(x=sat)) + geom_density()
```

#### Part b {-}

Summarize your observations from the plot. Comment on the basics: range, typical outcomes, shape. (Any theories about what might explain this non-normal shape?)

The range is from 840 to 1110. Typical outcome is around 910 and 1030. Shape of the graph is two humps. 



### Exercise 2: SAT Scores vs Per Pupil Spending & SAT Scores vs Salaries {-}

The first question we'd like to answer is: Can the variability in `sat` scores from state to state be partially explained by how much a state spends on education, specifically its per pupil spending (`expend`) and typical teacher `salary`?

#### Part a {-}

```{r}
# Construct a plot of sat vs expend
# Include a "best fit linear regression model" (HINT: method = "lm")
ggplot(education, aes(x = sat, y = expend)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method = "lm")
```

```{r}
# Construct a plot of sat vs salary
# Include a "best fit linear regression model" (HINT: method = "lm")
ggplot(education, aes(x = sat, y = salary)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method = "lm")
```

#### Part b {-}

What are the relationship trends between SAT scores and spending? Is there anything that surprises you?

Negative correlation between SAT score and spending/salary. It is surprising because higher teacher salary might indicate higher education quality?

### Exercise 3: SAT Scores vs Per Pupil Spending *and* Teacher Salaries {-}

Construct *one* visualization of the relationship of `sat` with `salary` *and* `expend`. HINT: Start with just 2 variables and tweak that code to add the third variable. Try out a few things!

```{r}
ggplot(education, aes(x = sat, y = salary, size = expend)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method = "lm")
```



### Exercise 4: Another way to Incorporate Scale {-}

It can be tough to distinguish color scales and size scales for quantitative variables. Another option is to *discretize* a quantitative variable, or basically cut it up into *categories*.

Construct the plot below. Check out the code and think about what's happening here. What happens if you change "2" to "3"?

```{r eval = FALSE}
ggplot(education, aes(y = sat, x = salary, color = cut(expend, 3))) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(se = FALSE, method = "lm")
```

Describe the trivariate relationship between `sat`, `salary`, and `expend`.

sat/salary is positively correlated to expend.

### Exercise 5: Finally an Explanation {-}

It's strange that SAT scores *seem* to decrease with spending. But we're leaving out an important variable from our analysis: the fraction of a state's students that actually take the SAT. The `fracCat` variable indicates this fraction: `low` (under 15% take the SAT), `medium` (15-45% take the SAT), and `high` (at least 45% take the SAT).

#### Part a {-}

Build a univariate viz of `fracCat` to better understand how many states fall into each category.

```{r}
ggplot(education, aes(x = fracCat)) + geom_bar()
```

#### Part b {-}

Build 2 bivariate visualizations that demonstrate the relationship between `sat` and `fracCat`. What story does your graphic tell and why does this make contextual sense?

```{r}
ggplot(education, aes(x = fracCat, y = sat)) + geom_boxplot()
```

SAT score is negatively correlated to the percentage of students who take SAT.

#### Part c {-}

Make a trivariate visualization that demonstrates the relationship of `sat` with `expend` AND `fracCat`. Highlight the differences in `fracCat` groups through color AND unique trend lines. What story does your graphic tell?\
Does it still seem that SAT scores decrease as spending increases?

```{r}
ggplot(education, aes(x = expend, y = sat, color = fracCat)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method = "lm")
```

#### Part d {-}

Putting all of this together, explain this example of **Simpsonâ€™s Paradox**. That is, why did it appear that SAT scores decrease as spending increases even though the *opposite* is true?

Because the percentage of students who take SAT is a very important and relevant factor of average SAT score, leaving it out would show the trend to be otherwise.


## Exercises (optional)

### Exercise 6: Heat Maps {-}

As usual, we've only just scratched the surface! There are lots of other data viz techniques for exploring multivariate relationships. Let's start with a **heat map**.

#### Part a {-}

Run the chunks below. Check out the code, but don't worry about every little detail! NOTES:

-   This is *not* part of the `ggplot()` grammar, making it a bit complicated.
-   If you're curious about what a line in the plot does, comment it out (`#`) and check out what happens!
-   In the plot, for each state (row), each variable (column) is scaled to indicate whether the state has a relative high value (yellow), a relatively low value (purple), or something in between (blues/greens).
-   You can also play with the color scheme. Type `?cm.colors` in the *console* to learn about various options.
-   We'll improve the plot later, so don't spend too much time trying to learn something from this plot.

```{r eval = FALSE, fig.width = 8, fig.height = 15}
# Remove the "State" column and use it to label the rows
# Then scale the variables
plot_data <- education |> 
  column_to_rownames("State") |> 
  data.matrix() |> 
  scale()

# Load the gplots package needed for heatmaps
library(gplots)

# Construct heatmap 1
heatmap.2(plot_data,
  dendrogram = "none",
  Rowv = NA, 
  scale = "column",
  keysize = 0.7, 
  density.info = "none",
  col = hcl.colors(256), 
  margins = c(10, 20),
  colsep = c(1:7), rowsep = (1:50), sepwidth = c(0.05, 0.05),
  sepcolor = "white", trace = "none"
)
```

```{r eval = FALSE, fig.width = 8, fig.height = 15}
# Construct heatmap 2
heatmap.2(plot_data,
  dendrogram = "none",
  Rowv = TRUE,             ### WE CHANGED THIS FROM NA TO TRUE
  scale = "column",
  keysize = 0.7, 
  density.info = "none",
  col = hcl.colors(256), 
  margins = c(10, 20),
  colsep = c(1:7), rowsep = (1:50), sepwidth = c(0.05, 0.05),
  sepcolor = "white", trace = "none"
)
```

```{r eval = FALSE, fig.width = 8, fig.height = 15}
# Construct heatmap 3
heatmap.2(plot_data,
  dendrogram = "row",       ### WE CHANGED THIS FROM "none" TO "row"
  Rowv = TRUE,            
  scale = "column",
  keysize = 0.7, 
  density.info = "none",
  col = hcl.colors(256), 
  margins = c(10, 20),
  colsep = c(1:7), rowsep = (1:50), sepwidth = c(0.05, 0.05),
  sepcolor = "white", trace = "none"
)
```

#### Part b {-}

In the final two plots, the states (rows) are rearranged by similarity with respect to these education metrics. The *final* plot includes a **dendrogram** which further indicates *clusters* of similar states. In short, states that have a shorter path to connection are more similar than others.

Putting this all together, what insight do you gain about the education trends across U.S. states? Which states are similar? In what ways are they similar? Are there any outliers with respect to 1 or more of the education metrics?

Geographically, the closer the states to each other, the more similiar their eductation. Minnesota, Wisconsin, Illinois are very similar to each other in terms of spending and sat etc, with Michigan being less similar. California and Utah have very high "ratio".


### Exercise 7: Star plots {-}

Like heat maps, star plots indicate the relative scale of each variable for each state. Thus, we can use star maps to identify similar groups of states, and unusual states!

#### Part a {-}

Construct and check out the star plot below. Note that each state has a "pie", with each segment corresponding to a different variable. The larger a segment, the larger that variable's value is in that state. For example:

-   Check out Minnesota. How does Minnesota's education metrics compare to those in other states? What metrics are relatively high? Relatively low?
-   What states appear to be similar? Do these observations agree with those that you gained from the heat map?

```{r eval = FALSE, fig.width = 10, fig.height = 20}
stars(plot_data,
  flip.labels = FALSE,
  key.loc = c(10, 1.5),
  cex = 1, 
  draw.segments = TRUE
)
```

#### Part b {-}

Finally, let's plot the state stars by *geographic* location! What new insight do you gain here?!

```{r eval = FALSE, fig.width = 10, fig.height = 7}
stars(plot_data,
  flip.labels = FALSE,
  locations = data.matrix(as.data.frame(state.center)),  # added external data to arrange by geo location
  key.loc = c(-110, 28),
  cex = 1, 
  draw.segments = TRUE
)
```
